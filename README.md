<p align="left">For this project, I used GPT and GitHub Copilot to develop my own version of Tic Tac Toe. I provided the AI with step-by-step instructions on how to write the code. I was then able to make adjustments and implement the project according to my vision. The goal of the task was to use AI to build the code according to my precise instructions. I created the graphics using Adobe Illustrator.
